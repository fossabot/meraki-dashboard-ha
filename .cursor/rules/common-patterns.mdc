# Common Patterns
- Use context7 mcp server for all supported libraries/documentation and search for docs there before doing your own search

## Adding New Sensor Types
1. Add metric constant to `const.py`
2. Add sensor description to `sensor.py` or `binary_sensor.py` or to the relevant .py file in the `devices` folder
3. Update `icons.json` for new sensor types
4. Test with actual device data

## Entity & Device Management
- Create devices for physical hardware
- Create entities for individual metrics
- Use proper device classes and units
- Include all available attributes from API
- Support dynamic device discovery

## Configuration
- Support both config entries and options flow
- Allow users to select specific devices
- Make update intervals configurable
- Support runtime configuration changes

## Development Workflow
1. Use update coordinators for efficient data fetching
2. Write tests for all new functionality (pytest + HA test helpers)
3. Mock external API calls in tests
4. Test both success and failure scenarios
5. Run tests and linting before committing

## Documentation
1. Documentation should live inside the `docs/` folder as this is rendered to a github static site for docs
2. Do not put any documentation into the repository root only into docs/ folder
3. Prefer updating existing documentation rather than adding new docs files

# API Guidelines

## Meraki SDK Usage
- Always use Meraki Python SDK for all API interactions
- Never make direct HTTP calls to the Meraki API
- Implement proper rate limiting and error handling
- Use batch operations where possible
- Cache device information appropriately

## Error Handling
- Implement ConfigEntryAuthFailed and ConfigEntryNotReady appropriately
- Log errors at appropriate levels with helpful messages
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Handle API authentication errors gracefully
- Use Home Assistant's built-in helpers and utilities

## Performance Optimization
- Minimize API calls using batch operations
- Respect Meraki's rate limits
- Use appropriate update intervals
- Implement efficient data structures
- Cache device information appropriately

## Data Management
- Include all available attributes from API
- Support dynamic device discovery
- Make update intervals configurable
- Use proper device classes and units

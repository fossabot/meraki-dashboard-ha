- Use fixtures to manage setup and teardown of test environments efficiently.
- Organize tests into directories and use meaningful names for test files and functions.
- Leverage pytest markers to categorize tests (e.g., unit, integration) for selective execution.
- Aim for high test coverage, but prioritize meaningful tests over quantity.

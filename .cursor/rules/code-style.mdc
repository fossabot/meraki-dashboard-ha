- Use Google-style docstrings with type information
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Early returns to reduce nesting
- Descriptive variable names (no single letters except in comprehensions)
- Use f-strings for string formatting

## Home Assistant Conventions
- Follow Home Assistant integration patterns and conventions
- Use Home Assistant's built-in helpers and utilities
- Implement proper error handling with ConfigEntryAuthFailed and ConfigEntryNotReady
- Use update coordinators for efficient data fetching

## File Organization

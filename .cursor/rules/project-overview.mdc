# Meraki Dashboard Home Assistant Integration

## Project Context
Home Assistant custom integration for Cisco Meraki Dashboard API, focusing on MT series environmental sensors with plans to expand to other device types.

## Core Principles
- Always use Poetry to run any terminal command involving python to ensure proper venv setup
- Always use Meraki Python SDK for all API interactions (never direct HTTP calls)
- Follow Home Assistant integration patterns and conventions
- Implement proper async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Use type hints throughout the codebase

## Key Files
- `__init__.py` - Main integration setup and hub class
- `config_flow.py` - UI configuration flow
- `sensor.py` - Sensor platform implementation
- `binary_sensor.py` - Binary sensor platform implementation
- `const.py` - Constants and configuration keys
- `manifest.json` - Integration metadata
- `strings.json` - UI strings and translations

## Git & Documentation
- Use conventional commits format
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Reference issues in commit messages
- Update documentation for all changes
- Test integration in actual Home Assistant instance

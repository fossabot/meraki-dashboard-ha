# Meraki Dashboard Integration Refactoring Tasks

## Task Execution Guidelines for LLMs

### General Instructions:
1. **Test First**: Run existing tests before starting each task to ensure baseline functionality
2. **Incremental Changes**: Implement changes incrementally, testing after each major modification
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all existing functionality continues to work and Home Assistant device names or entity IDs remain unchanged
4. **Documentation**: Update docstrings and comments for modified code
5. **Type Safety**: Add or improve type hints for all new code
6. **Error Handling**: Maintain or improve existing error handling patterns
7. Consume the .mdc files in the `.cursor/rules` folder for general project instructions and guidance.
8. Do not run any git commands

### Phase Execution Order:
- Complete all Phase 1 tasks before moving to Phase 2
- Each task within a phase can be done independently
- Run full test suite after completing each phase
- Verify integration functionality after each task

### Success Validation:
- All existing tests must pass
- Integration setup and normal operations must work unchanged
- New code must have appropriate test coverage
- Type checking (mypy) should pass without errors
- No new linting issues should be introduced

### Task Management:
- Remove completed tasks from their section and move to the "COMPLETED TASKS" section
- Mark any issues or blockers encountered during task execution in this file
- Maintain this file as a living document of refactoring progress
- Ensure this file is updated with status and instructions for future sessions

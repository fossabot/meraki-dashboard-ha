# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### üöÄ Added - Multi-Hub Architecture
- **Multi-Hub Architecture**: Complete redesign with organization and network hubs
  - Organization hub manages API connection and coordinates network hubs
  - Network hubs handle specific device types per network (e.g., "Main Office - MT", "Branch - MR")
  - Automatic hub creation only when devices of that type exist
  - Proper device hierarchy: Organization ‚Üí Network Hubs ‚Üí Individual Devices ‚Üí Entities

### üì° Added - MR Wireless Device Support
- **MR Series Support**: Initial wireless access point monitoring (proof of concept)
  - SSID count (total configured SSIDs)
  - Enabled SSIDs (currently active networks)
  - Open SSIDs (unsecured networks)
  - Network hub diagnostics and controls
  - Foundation for expanded wireless monitoring features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Changed - Per-Hub Interval Configuration
- **Optimized Default Intervals**: Device-type specific intervals for better performance
  - MT Environmental Sensors: 10 minutes (was 20 minutes)
  - MR Wireless Access Points: 5 minutes (new)
  - Discovery: 1 hour (was 1 hour)
  - MS/MV (Future): 5 minutes infrastructure monitoring
- **Per-Hub Control**: Configure individual intervals for each network and device type
- **UI Improvements**: Configuration now uses minutes instead of seconds
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configurations automatically migrated

### üéõÔ∏è Added - Hub Management Controls
- **Organization-Level Controls**:
  - Update all hubs with single action
  - Discover devices across all networks
  - Organization-wide diagnostics and status
- **Network-Level Controls**:
  - Update individual hub data
  - Discover devices for specific hub
  - Hub-specific diagnostics and metrics

### üì± Enhanced - Device Management
- **Improved Device Registry**: Proper hierarchy with network hubs as parents
- **Device Information**: Consolidated comprehensive device specifications into usage guide
- **Hub Diagnostics**: API call statistics, update timing, device counts per hub
- **Better Organization**: Devices nested under appropriate network hubs

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure - Scalable Foundation
- **Future Device Types**: Infrastructure ready for MS (switches) and MV (cameras)
- **Device Type Mappings**: Extensible system for adding new device categories
- **Hub Factory Pattern**: Automatic creation based on device discovery
- **API Optimization**: Better distribution of API calls across hubs and time

### üìñ Updated - Documentation
- **Architecture Guide**: New multi-hub architecture explanation with diagrams
- **Configuration Guide**: Per-hub interval configuration and optimization tips
- **Usage Guide**: Consolidated device information from separate device pages
- **API Reference**: Updated for new hub classes and multi-hub patterns
- **FAQ**: Updated for new architecture and interval system

### üîÑ Changed - Breaking Changes (Backward Compatible)
- **Hub Structure**: New multi-hub architecture (existing entities preserved)
- **Configuration**: New per-hub interval system (automatic migration)
- **Device Pages**: Consolidated into general usage guide (removed device-specific pages)

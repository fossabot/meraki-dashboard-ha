There's an API endpoint getDeviceLldpCdp that returns lldb data based on the target MS device serial. Can we add this metadata to every and MS device as an attribute to a new entity "LLDP Clients" which for each MS device the entity will show a total count of LLDP clients for that device and then in the attributes store the actual    │
│   LLDB data? An example of the complete endpoint call and returned code is below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 │
